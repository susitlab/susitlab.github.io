<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I received my Ph.D. from Sorbonne Université, Paris, France, in 2018, under the direction of Pascal Laugier (Member, European Academy of Sciences) and Quentin Grimal.

From 2018 to 2020, I was in Ferrara Lab at Stanford University for postdoctoral research training under the direction of Katherine W. Ferrara (Member, National Academy of Engineering).

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Science and Technology at ShanghaiTech University.

Our work is supported by 'National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai', 'Shanghai High-Level Overseas Talent Program', 'Shanghai Sailing Program' and a grant from 'Key Laboratory of Biomedical Imaging Science and System, Chinese Academy of Sciences'.

I received the second place award for the talk presented at the Youth Forum of 2023 WIFUMB, the best talk award at the IBDW (2017) and the traveling award of IUS (2017).

I served as a co-chair for the sessions at IEEE IUS 2023,2024 and ESUCB 2017, and as a reviewer for IEEE TMI、IEEE TUFFC、Ultrasonics、Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology、Acta Biomaterilia、Scientific Reports、Measurement、声学学报、Ultrasonic Imaging、Nanoscale, etc.

# ✡️ Research Interests
